# School Management System in PHP

## Introduction

This project is aimed to create a school management system to increase overall
efficiency and do the following:

1. Student information management.
2. Teacher Management.
3. Attendance Management.
4. Classroom Management.
5. Subject Management.
6. Exam Management

> This Project aims to address the challenges faced by schools in effectively managing various aspects of their operations. It provides a comprehensive school management system that streamlines processes and improves efficiency in handling student information, teacher management, attendance tracking, classroom organisation, subject management, and exam administration. By centralising and automating these tasks, the Portfolio Project helps schools enhance their administrative capabilities, optimise resource allocation, and ensure smooth operations for better educational outcomes. It is designed to provide a comprehensive school management system, but it does not address issues beyond its scope. It will not directly solve educational challenges such as curriculum development, instructional methodologies, student learning outcomes, or teacher-student interactions. Additionally, it may not address broader institutional concerns like budget management, facility maintenance, or community engagement. The Portfolio Project primarily focuses on streamlining administrative processes and optimising operational efficiency within the specified areas of student and teacher management, attendance tracking, classroom organisation, subject management, and exam administration. It helps school administrators, principals, teachers, and staff members by providing a centralised system for managing student and teacher information, attendance, classrooms, subjects, and exams. It streamlines administrative tasks and improves operational efficiency within educational institutions.Overall, it is not inherently dependent on a specific locale, including Somalia. Its functionalities and features can be adapted and utilised in various educational settings around the world. While it can be implemented in Somalia or any other country, customization may be required to align with specific local regulations, policies, and requirements. The core purpose of the Portfolio Project remains consistent regardless of the locale to assist educational institutions in managing their administrative tasks effectively.
